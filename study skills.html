                        <p>I believe that I had an impact in my life by studying the Book of Mormon and I want to share my ways of learning with others. If you want to enhance your understanding of the scriptures and have them in your life or even if you just want to test the waters these are my ways that helped me.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="post-title">Get into a routine</h4>
                        <p>Set aside some time each day for scripture study. A routine helps your mind focus, making it easier to understand and connect with the teachings. It can be as short as 5 minutes but being able to have a session can help your day or night so much more.</p>
                        <p>I try to read at lease a page a night. It's a short amount of time but I feel closer to God each day. It also removes a lot of pressure knowing that I can go at my own pace.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Try Journaling</h4>
                        <p>Keeping a journal is way to write down your personal thoughts, insights, and questions as you read without feeling that you have to share it to anyone else. It helps you reflect on the teachings, encouraging a deeper connection with the spiritual aspects of the Book of Mormon.</p>
                        <p>I think that journaling is a way to grow your faith in a more personal way. I had never kept a journal growing up but now I find it very calming and theraputic. I have used this becuase I am shy with sharing my testimony and my questions because I feel like they were the wrong things to say. I have felt so much safer now knowing that these are things I can keep for myself.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Focus on a Theme</h4>
                        <p>Instead of reading cover to cover, concentrate on specific themes during your study sessions. This focused approach allows for a better understanding of the teachings and helps you appreciate the deeper messages in the Book of Mormon.</p>
                        <p>When I focus on themes I feel that I have a stronger connection to my readings. When I start at the beginning I feel unmotivated to continue reading but, when I find something that I have an interest in I want to continue learning more. This is also on my own pace. I don't have to rush on understanding everything in the scriptures and just focus of the theme I think will be the best at that time.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Color your study</h4>
                        <p>Add some creativity to your study by using color. Highlight important passages or use markers to organize themes. Visual aids make it easier to identify patterns and connections in the scriptures, enhancing your overall understanding.</p>
                        <p>I can not tell you how much I love to color! Adding a bit of color has helped me understand the reading and it reminds me what I think is important. This is my favorite way to read the Book of Mormon. I get a few different colors and highlight what I like. I use multiple colors so it doesn't all mix in together.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Look at modern applications</h4>
                        <p>Relate the teachings to you life. Connect the ancient scripture to modern situations. Finding practical applications makes the Book of Mormon more relevant and helps you appreciate its timeless wisdom in your everyday expereiences.</p>
                        <p>Finding something you can relate to is another really important thing. When I read the scriptures, I try to see how this will help me in my life currently. One situation I went through was about stress. I went to the back of the Book of Mormon and looked for peace during hard times. I felt a stronger connection because it was something I was going through personally. THe Book of Mormon helped me when I needed it.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Use technology</h4>
                        <p>Include online tools and resources into your study. Technology provides additional insights into the historical context of the Book of Mormon.</p>
                        <p>I will be honest, I am not as tech savy as I wish but this doesn't mean that I haven't used it to help me during my studies. If you learn better on a screen I would encourage you to use it. I am personally a paper person, I like a physical copy but I think it is a great resource to find specific scriptures, talks and lessons that you want to focus on.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Pray for guidance</h4>
                        <p>Before reading, take a moment to pray for understanding. Seeking divine guidance through prayer opens your heart to spiritual insights, developing a deeper connection with the scripture beyond intellectual comprehension.</p>
                        <p>I can not tell you how important prayer is in my life. Before reading my scriptures, I say a tiny prayer asking for God's support on my studies. Knowing that there is someone out there who know I am trying and I want to learn helps me feel like I am not completely alone.</p>

                        <h4 class="post-title">Have fun</h4>
                        <p>Don't make reading the scriptures a chore. Find the fin in sicovering the language, stories, and spiritual truths in the Book of Mormon. A positive attitude can make your session more enjoyable and meaningful.</p>
                        <p>Growing up, I did not like reading the scriptures every night. It was the hardest thing for me to do because it wasn't fun. I still feel like it can be boring, but if you try to come with a postive attitude and even inviting friends or family to participate could make it better. I make it fun by coloring in a pattern, so when I am done with my reading it looks all pretty and orginized whcih makes me feel proud of myself.</p>
